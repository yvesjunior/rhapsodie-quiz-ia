# How to Convert Your Figma Design to Flutter

## What I Can Do For You

I can help convert your Figma designs to Flutter code in several ways:

### Option 1: Provide Design Specifications
Share with me:
- **Screenshots** of your Figma designs
- **Design tokens**: Colors, fonts, spacing values
- **Layout descriptions**: How elements are arranged
- **Component descriptions**: What each screen contains

I'll create Flutter code matching your design exactly.

### Option 2: Export from Figma First
1. Use **Figma to Flutter plugin** to generate base code
2. Share the generated code with me
3. I'll refine it, add API integration, and optimize it

### Option 3: Manual Conversion
1. Export assets (images, icons) from Figma
2. Share design specs (measurements, colors, fonts)
3. I'll build the Flutter widgets manually

## What I Need From You

### For Best Results, Provide:

1. **Screenshots** of each screen:
   - Home/QCM List screen
   - QCM Question screen
   - Results screen
   - Leaderboard screen
   - Any other screens

2. **Design Tokens** (or I can extract from screenshots):
   ```
   Colors:
   - Primary: #667eea
   - Secondary: #764ba2
   - Background: #F8F9FA
   
   Typography:
   - Heading: 24px, Bold
   - Body: 16px, Regular
   
   Spacing:
   - Small: 8px
   - Medium: 16px
   - Large: 24px
   ```

3. **Layout Information**:
   - Component positions
   - Padding/margins
   - Border radius
   - Shadows/elevations

I'll create production-ready Flutter code for your QCM app!
